         <Ul>
             <li>I've always had a love for music even as a child. I was taught by my older brother at age six, and had showed promise of talent to my parents. They got me professional lessons at eight, and my progress soared. Although I wasn't very competitive, I was able to perform difficult pieces. </li>

             <li>This video above is my third ever performance at around age ten. I performed John Schmidt's waterfall that I had been working on for the past couple months.

    <li id="com">Competitions
        <ul>
            <li>As I progressed rapidly through my younger years, my parents gave me a master instructor at around twelve year of age. From here, I was drilled into perfection with immense amounts of technique, theory, and history studies. </li>
            <li>After improving tremendously, my teacher gave me opportunities to perform and compete. For most of my high school career, I was playing in local competitions, competiting for prize money. During my Junior, I won my largest prize ever which allowed me to pay for college. This was an amazing moment of my life, I  have been so blessed because of it. </li>
            <li>Finally, the peak of my senior came an opportunitiy of a lifetime. I had won a competition that allowed me to perform with a live orchestra. I performed a Rachmaninoff concerto and having the orchestra to play with me was amazing. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li id="mea">Meaning to Me
        <ul>
            <li> Piano and music in general has a spiritual connection to me. When I'm performing my favorite composers, or church songs, I can feel the spirit stronger than other things. It's a way for me to feel at peace, and feeling the spirit helps me with this. </li>
            <li> Music also has speical meaning to me because it can uplift others. My mother can hardly hear anymore, but she loves it when I play for her. This gives me immense joy knowing that I can make her day with music. For my senior year project at high school, I performed rag time songs for multiple senior center homes. This was also a special moment because I got to see the smiling faces of people dancing to music. </li>
